# human

Go library of types for parsing and formatting value in human-friendly
representations.

This library was originally developped as a sub-package of
[github.com/segmentio/cli](https://github.com/segmentio/cli).
This fork extracts the parsing and formatting features into a dedicated
package, and adds a couple of bug fixes and usability improvements.
